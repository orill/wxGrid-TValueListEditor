# wxGrid-TValueListEditor
LCL / VCL TValueListEditor behaviour of wxGrid in wxWidgets

Here is an attempt to reproduce the behavior of LCL / VCL TValueListEditor widget where rows are added by the "PageDown" key.
The last row is deleted by the "PageUp" key.

Feel free to modify this example to get an equivalent of TValueListEditor with wxWidgets.
